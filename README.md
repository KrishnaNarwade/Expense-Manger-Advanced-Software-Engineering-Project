# 1 Git 
I am using Git to always push my code and required file.
I recently have pushed my Expense tracker Python code, requirment.txt file and the UML diagrams.
My git times can be seen at the contribution chart in GitHub.

# 2 UML

I decided to draw 3 UML diagrams i.e 
1) [Activity Daigram](https://github.com/KrishnaNarwade/Expense-Manger-Advanced-Software-Engineering-Project/blob/main/UML%20Diagrams./UML%20Activity%20Diagram1.png):
This activity diagram shows progression and action of the Expense tracker tool.

2) [Use Case Diagram](https://github.com/KrishnaNarwade/Expense-Manger-Advanced-Software-Engineering-Project/blob/main/UML%20Diagrams./Use_Case_Daigram1.png):
This Use-case diagrams describe the high-level functions and scope of a Expense tracker tool.
It also shows interaction between User and System.

3) Component diagram (Still in progress.)
This Component diagram will show the components the expense tracker tool and how they are wired together.

# 3) DDD
Attaching the Darft version of the [DDD](https://github.com/KrishnaNarwade/Expense-Manger-Advanced-Software-Engineering-Project/blob/main/UML%20Diagrams./DDD%20Expense%20Tracker.jpg) diagram.
