# 1 Git 
I am using Git to always push my code and required file.
I recently have pushed my Expense tracker Python code, requirment.txt file and the UML diagrams.
My git times can be seen at the contribution chart in GitHub.

# 2 UML

I decided to draw 3 UML diagrams i.e 
1) [Activity Daigram](https://github.com/KrishnaNarwade/Expense-Manger-Advanced-Software-Engineering-Project/blob/main/UML%20Diagrams./UML%20Activity%20Diagram1.png):
This activity diagram shows progression and action of the Expense tracker tool.

2) [Use Case Diagram](https://github.com/KrishnaNarwade/Expense-Manger-Advanced-Software-Engineering-Project/blob/main/UML%20Diagrams./Use_Case_Daigram1.png):
This Use-case diagrams describe the high-level functions and scope of a Expense tracker tool.
It also shows interaction between User and System.
